LitElement renders and re-renders asynchronously, updating in response to batched property changes (see [Element update lifecycle](#lifecycle) for more information).

During an update, only the parts of the DOM that change are re-rendered. To get the performance benefits of this model, you should **design your element's template as a pure function of its properties**.

To do this, make sure the `render` function:

* Does not change the element's state.
* Does not have any side effects.
* Only depends on the element's properties.
* Returns the same result when given the same property values.

Also, avoid making DOM updates outside of `render`. Instead, express the element's template as a function of its state, and capture its state in properties. 

The following code uses inefficient DOM manipulation:

_dom-manip.js_

```text
// Anti-pattern. Avoid!

constructor() {
  super();
  this.addEventListener('stuff-loaded', (e) => {
    this.shadowRoot.getElementById('message').innerHTML=e.detail;
  });
  this.loadStuff();
}
render() {
  return html`
    <p id="message">Loading</p>
  `;
}
```

We can improve the template by capturing the load message as a property, and setting the property in response to the event:

_update-properties.js_

```js
constructor() {
  super();
  this.message = 'Loading';
  this.addEventListener('stuff-loaded', (e) => { this.message = e.detail } );
  this.loadStuff();
}
render() {
  return html`
    <p>${this.message}</p>
  `;
}
```
