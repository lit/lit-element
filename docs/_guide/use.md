This page describes how to [use a LitElement component in your application](#use). It also describes how to make sure your deployed code is browser-ready by [building it for production](#build) and [loading the Web Components polyfills](#polyfills).

## Use a LitElement component {#use}

This is a general guide to using third-party LitElement components. Refer to a component's README or other documentation for specific details.

To use a LitElement component in your code:

1.  From your project folder, install the component from npm.

    ```
    npm install some-package-name
    ```

2.  Import the component.

    In a JavaScript module: 

    ```js
    import 'some-package-name';
    ```

    In an HTML page:

    ```html
    <script type="module">
    import './path-to/some-package-name/some-component.js';
    </script>
    ```

    Or:

    ```html
    <script type="module" src="./path-to/some-package-name/some-component.js"></script>
    ```

3.  Add the component to your application or component:

    ```html
    <some-component></some-component>
    ```

## Develop {#develop}

Elements built with LitElement are published to npm as standard JavaScript modules, which all major browsers can now load. 

However, LitElement and elements built with it import their dependencies using bare module specifiers (for example, `import { ... } from 'module-name'`) instead of full paths (`import {...} from '../path/to/module-name'`). 

At the time of writing, browsers must still be provided with the full path to a standard JavaScript module in order to load it. To convert bare module specifiers to full paths, a light transform is required.

For a local server that does this automatically, try the [Open Web Components ES dev server](https://open-wc.org/developing/es-dev-server.html). 

## Build for production {#build}

To build for production, you can use a bundler such as WebPack or Rollup.

The following example configuration for [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) resolves dependencies, converts bare module specifers to paths, and bundles the output.

**rollup.config.js**

```js
import resolve from 'rollup-plugin-node-resolve';

export default {
  // If using any exports from a symlinked project, uncomment the following:
  // preserveSymlinks: true,
	input: ['src/index.js'],
	output: {
		file: 'build/index.js',
		format: 'es',
		sourcemap: true
	},
	plugins: [
    resolve()
  ]
};
```

See a [sample build configuration for LitElement with Babel and Rollup](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/lit-element-build-rollup/blob/master/src/index.html).

## Load the WebComponents polyfills {#polyfills}

Elements built with LitElement use the Web Components set of standards, which are currently supported by all major browsers with the exception of Edge. 

For compatibility with older browsers and Edge, load the Web Components polyfills.

To load the WebComponents polyfills:

1.  From your project folder, install the `@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs` package:

    ```
    npm install --save-dev @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs
    ```

2.  Add the polyfills to your HTML entrypoint:

    ```html
    <head>
      <!-- 
        If you are loading es5 code you will need 
        custom-elements-es5-loader to make the element work in 
        es6-capable browsers. 
        
        If you are not loading es5 code, you don't need 
        custom-elements-es5-loader. 
      --> 
      <!-- 
      <script src="./path-to/custom-elements-es5-loader.js"></script>
      -->

      <!-- Load polyfills -->
      <script 
        src="path-to/webcomponents-loader.js"
        defer>
      </script> 

      <!-- Load component when polyfills are definitely ready -->
      <script type="module">
        // Take care of cases in which the browser runs this
        // script before it has finished running 
        // webcomponents-loader.js (e.g. Firefox script execution order)
        window.WebComponents = window.WebComponents || { 
          waitFor(cb){ addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', cb) }
        }

        WebComponents.waitFor(async () => { 
          import('./path-to/some-element.js');
        });
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- Add the element to the page -->
      <some-element></some-element>
    </body>
    ```

3.  Ensure that `node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js` and `node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/bundles/**.*` are included in your build.

<div class="alert"> 

**Do not transpile the polyfills.** Bundling them is okay.
